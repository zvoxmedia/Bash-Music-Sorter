# Bash-Music-Sorter
A bash script to sort music files by highest quality, cut the rest, and also cut unnecessary files.

So far, I ran this script in my Ubuntu Studio OS, and I got this error.

/home/strheeljack/Downloads/music.sh: 16: [: /home/strheeljack/MusicDuplicate/'Chammak Challo Ra.One' (video song) ShahRukh Khan,Kareena Kapoor-lxB-ki-qE64.jpg: unexpected operator
/home/strheeljack/Downloads/music.sh: 30: Bad substitution
